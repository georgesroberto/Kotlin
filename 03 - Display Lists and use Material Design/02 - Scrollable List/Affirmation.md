# Affirmations App

- In this codelab, you learn how to make a scrollable list in your app using Jetpack Compose.

- You will be working with the Affirmations app, which displays a list of affirmations paired with beautiful images to bring positivity to your day!

- The data is already there, all you need to do is take that data and display it in the UI.

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with Lists in Kotlin
2. Experience building layouts with Jetpack Compose
3. Experience running apps on a device or emulator

## What you'll learn

1. How to create a material design card using Jetpack Compose
2. How to create a scrollable list using Jetpack Compose

## What you'll build

- You will take an existing application and add a scrollable list to the UI
- The finished product will look like this:

- Keep in mind that these are just basic tools for creating a list.
- You can let your creativity roam and customize list items however you like!

### Changing APP iCON

#### Summary

- Place app icon files in the mipmap resource directories.
- Provide different versions of an app icon bitmap image in each density bucket (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi) for backwards compatibility with older versions of Android.
- Add resource qualifiers onto resource directories to specify resources that should be used on devices with a certain configuration (v24 or v26).
- Vector drawables are Android's implementation of vector graphics. They are defined in XML as a set of points, lines, and curves, along with associated color information. Vector drawables can be scaled for any density without loss of quality.
- Adaptive icons were introduced to the Android platform in API 26. They are made up of a foreground and background layer that follow specific requirements, so that your app icon looks high-quality on a range of devices with different OEM masks.
- Use Image Asset Studio in Android Studio to create legacy and adaptive icons for your app.

## Changing APP iCON

### Summary

- Place app icon files in the mipmap resource directories.
- Provide different versions of an app icon bitmap image in each density bucket (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi) for backwards compatibility with older versions of Android.
- Add resource qualifiers onto resource directories to specify resources that should be used on devices with a certain configuration (v24 or v26).
- Vector drawables are Android's implementation of vector graphics. They are defined in XML as a set of points, lines, and curves, along with associated color information. Vector drawables can be scaled for any density without loss of quality.
- Adaptive icons were introduced to the Android platform in API 26. They are made up of a foreground and background layer that follow specific requirements, so that your app icon looks high-quality on a range of devices with different OEM masks.
- Use Image Asset Studio in Android Studio to create legacy and adaptive icons for your app.

In the SmartDevice class, define a printDeviceInfo() method that prints a "Device name: $name, category: $category, type: $deviceType" string.
In the SmartTvDevice class, define a decreaseVolume() method that decreases the volume and a previousChannel() method that navigates to the previous channel.
In the SmartLightDevice class, define a decreaseBrightness() method that decreases the brightness.
In the SmartHome class, ensure that all actions can only be performed when each device's deviceStatus property is set to an "on" string. Also, ensure that the deviceTurnOnCount property is updated correctly.

After you're done with the implementation:

In the SmartHome class, define an decreaseTvVolume(), changeTvChannelToPrevious(), printSmartTvInfo(), printSmartLightInfo(), and decreaseLightBrightness() method.
Call the appropriate methods from the SmartTvDevice and SmartLightDevice classes in the SmartHome class.
In the main() function, call these added methods to test them.

# Congratulations

You've finished the Blur- O- Matic app and in the process learned about:

- Adding WorkManager to your Project
- Scheduling a OneTimeWorkRequest
- Input and Output parameters
- Chaining work together WorkRequests
- WorkManager supports a lot more than we could cover in this codelab, including
  - repetitive work
  - a testing support library
  - parallel work requests
  - input mergers.

# Variable Declaration in Kotlin

In Kotlin, you can declare variables using the `val` and `var` keywords. Here's how:

- Use `val` for read-only (immutable) variables. Once assigned, the value cannot be changed.
- Use `var` for mutable variables. You can change the value of a `var` variable.

Example:

```kotlin
val pi = 3.14 // Read-only variable
var count = 10 // Mutable variable
```

# SQL

**Congratulations!**

You learned a lot! You can now **read** from a database using

> SELECT statements, including:

```sql
WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses to filter results.
```

You also learned about frequently used aggregate functions, the **`DISTINCT`** keyword to specify unique results, and the **`LIKE`** keyword to perform a text search on the values in a column.

Finally, you learned how to

```sql
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
```

rows in a data table.
